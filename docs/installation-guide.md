# Main parts

## Getting ready

You're about to upgrade your fan!  It'll be awesome!

Set aside a couple of hours to partially disassemble your fan, install Minuet and your accessories, and reassemble your fan.  Take your time and you'll find the process fairly straightforward.

### Safety check

Confirm that your Maxxfan's electrical supply meets these requirements:

- Voltage: 12 V DC nominal and absolute maximum range from 9 to 16 V DC
- Wiring: minimum 18 AWG (0.8 mmÂ²)
- Circuit protection: 5 A fuse or circuit breaker

This should already be the case if your Maxxfan was installed correctly and it's just good to confirm.

### Supplies

Gather the supplies you will need.

- Parts
  - Minuet fan controller circuit board (already programmed with the Minuet firmware)
  - Fan motor and adapters
  - Power cable
  - Lid motor cable
  - Zip ties
- Tools
  - #2 Philips screwdriver, short length ("stubby"), to remove fasteners in a confined space under the lid
  - #2 Philips screwdriver, standard length
  - 7/64" allen key
  - 8 mm hex socket driver
  - Additional tools may be needed to assemble the brushless fan motor, if not preassembled

Review the instructions for any [accessories](#accessories) you may have for additional supplies.

## Assembling the brushless fan motor

Retrieve the fan motor, shaft adapter, and mount from your kit.  Assemble them, if not preassembled.

Shaft adapter:

1. Loosely install the grub screws into the 8 mm shaft coupler.
1. Seat the 8 mm dowel pin up to the midpoint of the coupler.  Gently tighten the coupler's grub screws onto the dowel pin.
1. Insert the coupler onto the motor shaft.  Gently tighten the coupler's grub screws onto the dowel pin.

Mount:

1. Screw the M5 screws through the mount from the side on which the motor is installed.  Tighten only until snug to avoid stripping the plastic threads.  Do not use threadlocker.
1. Screw the motor to the plate.  Add a washer on each screw between the screw head and the plate.

## Disassembling the Maxxfan

Start by clearing some space below the fan to work.  You do not need to remove the fan from the roof of your vehicle because all of the necessary fasteners are accessible from inside.

Choose a place to set things down.  Keep the removed parts and fasteners organized while you work to make reassembly easier.

1. Disconnect the electrical supply from the fan (such as by removing its fuse and setting it aside).  For safety, confirm that the fan is non-operational by attempting to turn the fan on (it should remain off).
1. Remove the insect screen by turning the plastic posts that retain it to the fan body until they unlatch.
1. Remove the fan blade from the motor shaft using a 7/64" allen key to loosen the grub screw until the fan blade slides off the shaft.
1. Fully open the lid by turning the lid knob counter-clockwise.
1. Reach up and trace the fan motor wires from the back of the fan motor down to where they are secured to the housing with zip ties.  Cut the zip ties.
1. Continue feeling along the fan motor wires to where they pass under a narrow plastic weatherguard.  The weatherguard obstructs the opening through which the wires enter the fan housing.
1. Feel around the weatherguard to locate two screw heads on opposite sides.  Removing the weatherguard is awkward because of the limited clearance for tools under the lid (even when fully opened).  Use a short length ("stubby") #2 Philips screwdriver to remove both screws from the weatherguard.  Remove the weatherguard.
1. Remove the lid knob using a #2 Philips screwdriver.
1. Remove the 4 screws that hold the control panel in place using a #2 Philips screwdriver.  These screws were previously hidden under the insect screen.
1. Assess whether you have enough clearance to access the wiring within the fan housing.  If your electrical supply wires or wall control cables are very tight then you may need to remove the trim rim to provide some slack.  Proceed with the next step once you're able to move the control panel a handspan away from the body of the fan.
1. Disconnect the wall controls from the circuit board, if present.
1. Disconnect the rain sensor from the circuit board, if present.
1. Disconnect the lid motor by gently pulling the plug and socket connectors apart.
1. Disconnect the fan motor by gently pulling the plug and socket connectors apart.
1. Disconnect (or cut) the electrical supply.  If you choose to cut these wires, make sure to leave enough slack on both ends to reconnect them later should you have need.
1. Now the control panel should be completely free of the body, set it aside.
1. Use a 8 mm socket driver to remove the M5 nuts that hold the fan motor to the housing and pay attention to the washers under the nuts so you don't lose them!
1. Remove the fan motor and put it away, you won't be needing it anymore but keep the washers and nuts.

That's it with disassembly.

## Installing the brushless fan motor

Assemble the fan motor, shaft adapter, and mount before proceeding.

1. Raise the fan motor into position in the center of the fan housing.  Align the mount's two protruding M5 screws with the mount holes in the housing and seat the mount into place.
1. Secure the mount with the original washers and M5 nuts using an 8 mm socket driver.  Do not overtighten.
1. Drape the fan motor wires along the upper side of the plastic spoke that supports the motor and guide them towards the corner of the housing above the electronics.
1. Pass the fan motor connector through the opening that was under the weatherguard.
1. Use two zip ties to secure the fan motor wires to the spoke.

If you are installing a light accessory, proceed to those instructions and install the LED light strip into the housing now.  The light's wires will pass through the same opening as the fan motor wires.

Now you have the option of reinstalling the weatherguard over the opening in the housing (the one that was so tricky to disassemble).  The weatherguard might help shed water in some circumstances but it doesn't seem necessary so you can omit reinstalling it to ease future maintenance.

To reinstall the weatherguard (optional):

1. The weatherguard has a notch that fits over the wires where they pass through it.  This notch originally only needed to be big enough for 2 wires but now there are more so the opening needs to be expanded to fit.  Carefully carve away excess plastic around the notch until it fits over all of the wires without crimping them.
1. Fully open the lid by turning the lid knob counter-clockwise.
1. Preinstall the screws into the weatherguard then seat it into place over the wire harness.
1. Tighten down the screws a little bit at a time while checking to ensure that the wires pass through the notch and don't get crimped by the plastic.

Now you can close the lid by turning the lid knob clockwise.

## Connecting the lid motor cable to the lid motor

Attach the Minuet lid motor cable to the lid motor by pressing the plug and socket connectors together.

## Connecting the power cable to the electrical supply

Attach the Minuet power cable to your electrical supply.  Use a vibration-resistant splicing method such as a lever or crimp connector.

Please pay careful attention to the polarity!

- Original Maxxfan power cable: positive is *black*, negative is *white*.
- Minuet power cable: positive is *red*, negative is *black*.  These colors are more conventional.

Make sure you know which is which if you intend to reuse the original wires.  When in doubt, check your electrical supply with a multi-meter before making new connections and label them accordingly.

## Removing the original circuit board from the control panel

Remove the original circuit board from the control panel.

1. Place the control panel onto a flat surface on its back.
1. Unplug the thermistor from the original circuit board.
1. Remove the 3 screws and plastic washers that hold the original circuit board to the control panel.
1. Gently unplug the flexible cable for the built-in keypad from the original circuit board.
1. Now the original circuit board should be free of the control panel, put it away since you won't be needing it anymore.
1. Keep the original screws and plastic washers.

## Installing the Minuet circuit board into the control panel

Ensure that you have completed the set-up process for your minuet circuit board before installing it.

1. Orient the Minuet circuit board with the header labeled **PANEL** facing down into the control panel.  Make sure that the 3 mounting holes line up with the plastic standoffs on the control panel.
1. Gently plug the flexible cable for the built-in keypad to the header labeled **PANEL**.
1. Screw the circuit board into place with the 3 screws and plastic washers that were used for the original circuit board.
1. Plug the thermistor connector into the socket labeled **TEMP**.  You can identify the thermistor by looking for a little black blob that's held into the fan housing with hot glue.  It's a temperature sensor for the thermostat.
1. If you have an accessory that plugs into the **EXPANSION** port, consult its installation instructions then plug it into the socket.  Take care to orient the accessory circuit board to fit within the outline of the main circuit board and ensure that its pins are fully seated.
1. If you have an accessory with a QWIIC interface, plug it into the **QWIIC** connector using a QWIIC cable.

## Reassembling the Maxxfan

During reassembly, it may help to have a second pair of hands to support the control panel while screwing it back into place.

1. Hold the control panel near the unit.
1. Plug the lid motor connector into the socket labeled **LID MOTOR**.
1. Plug the fan motor connector into the socket labeled **FAN MOTOR**.
1. Plug the rain sensor connector into the socket labeled **RAIN**, if you have one.
1. Plug the additional connectors for your accessory, if you have one.
1. Plug the Maxxfan wall control cable into the socket labeled **WALL CONTROL**, if you have one.
1. Plug the power connector into the socket labeled **POWER**.

Before completing the reassembly, optionally give the upgrade a quick test.  Consider enlisting a friend to help.

1. Support the control panel so it doesn't dangle and damage anything.
1. Reconnect the electrical supply (reinstall the 5 A fuse).
1. Press the `on/off` button on the built-in keypad to turn the fan on.  The lid should open and the fan motor should start spinning.
1. Press the `on/off` button again to turn the fan off.  The lid should close and the fan motor should stop spinning.
1. Disconnect the electrical supply (remove the 5 A fuse).

Now complete the reassembly.

1. Raise the control panel into place while guiding and gently tucking the wires into the open space within the housing so they don't get pinched and damaged during reinstallation.  Dress the wires carefully while you work.
1. Screw the control panel into place with the 4 original screws using a #2 Philips screwdriver.
1. Screw the lid knob into place using a #2 Philips screwdriver.
1. Press the fan blade onto the shaft and tighten the grub screw with a 7/64" allen key.  Make sure it spins freely.
1. Install the insect screen and turn the posts that retain it until they latch into place.
1. Reconnect the electrical supply (reinstall the 5 A fuse).

## Finishing up

Congratulations, you have finished installing Minuet!

Read the [user guide](./user-guide.md) and set it up just the way you like.

# Accessories

## Light accessory

Please follow these additional instructions for installing the light accessory.

### Additional supplies

- Parts
  - Minuet light accessory circuit board
  - LED light strip
  - 24-key RGBW LED infrared remote control

### Installing the light

After removing the fan blade, the weatherguard, and the control panel...

- Thoroughly clean the rim of the fan housing all the way around its circumference.
- Wipe the rim with alcohol to remove any remaining oils and ensure proper adhesion of the LED strip.  Allow to dry.
- Pass the LED strip connector and wire down through the opening above the electronics.
- Hold the head of the LED strip (the end with the wires attached) up to the rim of the fan housing in the corner nearest the electronics.  Align it with the underside of the plastic spokes that support the fan motor.  Confirm that you can wrap the LED strip all the way around the rim of the fan housing in a counter-clockwise loop as you look up into the fan.
- Peel back part of the adhesive release liner and press the LED strip where you held it.  Incrementally peel and apply the LED strip in a counter-clockwise loop as you look up into the fan.  Don't peel the whole release liner all at once!
- Press the LED strip firmly into place all the way around to activate the adhesive.

### Connecting the light

After plugging the main connectors into the Minuet circuit board...

- Plug the LED strip connector into the accessory circuit board socket labeled **LIGHT**.

### Testing the light

After connecting the electrical supply...

- Press and hold the `in/out` button for a second.  The light should turn on.
- Use the 24-key RGBW LED infrared remote control to change the color.
- Press and hold the `in/out` button for a second.  The light should turn off.

## Cover sensor accessory

Please follow these additional instructions for installing the cover sensor accessory.

### Additional supplies

- Parts
  - Cover sensor
  - Insulated vent cover (not included)
  - Magnet (optional, not included)
  - Gaffer's tape (not included)
- Tools
  - Multimeter (optional)

### Installing the cover sensor

After removing the control panel...

- Unscrew and remove the trim ring from the ceiling.
- Determine where to install the cover sensor:
  - If your insulated vent cover attaches to the trim ring with magnets, choose a non-essential magnet to remove from the trim ring.  Remove the magnet and mark the location for the cover sensor on the back side of the trim ring.
  - If your insulated vent cover doesn't have magnets, attach (sew, tape, or glue) a magnet to your vent cover somewhere along its perimeter where it comes into contact with the trim ring.  Mark the corresponding location for the cover sensor on the back side of the trim ring.
- Use gaffer's tape (or similar) to secure the cover sensor to the back side of the trim ring at the location that you marked.

Optional: To confirm the location of the cover sensor before you complete the installation, use a multimeter to test continuity between the two pins of the connector.  The circuit should be closed when you attach your insulated vent cover to the trim ring; otherwise the circuit should be open.

- Consider how to route the cover sensor cable from the sensor to the electronics in the corner of the fan housing.  The cover sensor cable will need to run along the back side of the trim ring towards the corner then invisibly tuck over or pass through a notch in the shroud to reach the electronics.
- Use more gaffer's tape (or similar) to secure the cover sensor cable along the route that you selected.
- Carefully reinstall the trim ring to the ceiling such that the cover sensor connector enters the fan housing near the electronics.

### Connecting the cover sensor

After plugging the main connectors into the Minuet circuit board...

- Plug the cover sensor connector into the socket labeled **LOCK**.

### Testing the cover sensor

After finishing the installation...

- If the fan is off, press the `on/off` button.  The fan should turn on.
- Attach the insulated vent cover.  The fan should turn off.
- Remove the insulated vent cover.  The fan should remain off (unless the thermostat turns it on automatically).
